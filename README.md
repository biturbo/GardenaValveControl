# GardenaValveControl

A simple control unit that allows to switch Gardena 9V Valves 

This project builds a controler (which serves as a substitute for e.g. the Gardena C14e) to interface up to two 9V-valves. It can be connected to a Raspberry Pi and integrated with OpenHAB or other home automation solutions via a REST based interface.
